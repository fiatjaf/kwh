Privacy Policy
==============

**kWh** doesn't collect any personal data, doesn't track websites you visit, doesn't collect any form of usage analytics, doesn't sends any information to any service over the internet -- in fact, it doesn't even have a server anywhere, it's just an extension installed in your computer.

The only places **kWh** sends information to are the URL endpoints you define in the settings page for the extension, the URLs that identify the Lightning nodes you want to talk to, which **kWh** assumes are under your control or under the control of a third-party you trust.

**kWh** stores only the information you explicitly write in the settings page: _node URL_, _username_ and _password_ (where applicable). That information, however, is only stored in your own browser, using the _local_ storage mode, not the _synced_ storage mode that saves data to a browser-determined sync server. So if the guarantees offered by the browser itself hold true _that information never leaves your browser_.

For more information on the browser guarantees on which **kWh** depends, please read Firefox's [Privacy Policy](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/privacy/websites/) and [Terms of Service](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/legal/terms/mozilla/) and Google Chrome [Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy) and [Terms of Service](https://ssl.gstatic.com/chrome/webstore/intl/en-US/gallery_tos.html).
